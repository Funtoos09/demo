#The Journey from Startup Agility to MNC Excellence

My career journey has been shaped by my experience across both startups and large organizations, where I developed vital technical and leadership skills that have helped push my career forward.

#Vistaran Techtronix Pvt. Ltd. (Junior System Administrator):

At Vistaran Techtronix, I started my professional career as a Junior System Administrator, gaining hands-on experience with IT infrastructure management and security protocols. The fast-paced startup environment taught me the value of wearing multiple hats and managing competing priorities while learning on the go.


<li>**Resilience:** In this resource-constrained environment, I learned to stay focused under pressure, managing several responsibilities simultaneously while delivering high-quality results.</li>
<li>**Adaptability:** I became adept at quickly adjusting to new challenges, troubleshooting complex issues under tight deadlines, and implementing flexible solutions that met business needs.</li>
<li>**Business Mindset:** Understanding the startup's need for cost-effective solutions, I learned to apply my technical skills to achieve practical outcomes that aligned with the company’s business goals, improving efficiency and security.</li>

#Einfochips (CloudOps & NOC Engineer):
At Einfochips, I expanded my skill set by working in a more structured corporate environment. My role as a CloudOps & NOC Engineer gave me the opportunity to work on large-scale security projects, manage teams, and drive strategic decisions for enhancing cloud infrastructure and automation.


<li>**Team Management**: I led cross-functional teams to deliver complex projects, from security enhancements to cloud infrastructure automation. I learned how to delegate effectively, manage diverse teams, and ensure collaboration across different functions.</li>
<li>**Decision-Making**: I was involved in critical decision-making processes, especially during high-stakes situations such as incident responses and risk management. My decisions minimized downtime and protected the organization’s infrastructure and data.</li>
<li>**Structured Execution**: With the solid foundation built at Vistaran, I applied my startup-acquired agility to a more formalized environment. I successfully automated cloud provisioning using Terraform and AWS and implemented security protocols to protect critical infrastructure.</li>

#Blending Startup Agility with MNC Expertise
My time at Vistaran Techtronix taught me how to be agile, resilient, and business-focused, while Einfochips gave me the opportunity to refine these skills in a more structured and collaborative environment. The combination of both experiences has shaped me into a versatile professional capable of driving results in both fast-paced startups and large-scale enterprises.
